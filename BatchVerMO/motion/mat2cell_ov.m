function I = mat2cell_ov(X,xx_s,xx_f,yy_s,yy_f,zz_s,zz_f,overlap,nd)

% converts a matrix into a cell array with overlapping elements
% INPUTS:
% X:            Input matrix
% grid_size:    size of each element without overlap
% overlap:      amount of overlap
% sz:           spatial size of X

% OUTPUT:
% I:            output cell array
