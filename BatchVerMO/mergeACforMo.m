function  [Afinal_alldays,MC,newIDs,merged_ROIs,close_ind,eachday_ind] = mergeACforMo(A,C,merge_thr,M,dmin,d1,d2)
% General Description: Merge neurons based on
%   spatial, temporal correlation, and their distance. Afinal will be
%   different for each day so that they are put into cell array where each day,
%   has its own cell. Yet, each day's A is merged from the exact neurons using the
%   exact weight matrix: max(diff(C,1,2))./STD, see 'C' in input. This
%   function is key in tracking neuron.
%   This function is very similar to mergeAC, but this one does not
%   eliminate neurons with low signal. It also requires C as opposed to
%   ACS. Its emphasis is on the handling of multi-day data in the same way.
% input:
%   A:    concatenated A from neurons from many files registered towards
%           one day. That day should be the most confidently registered A.
%   C:    BigC(in ReadMe) of each file concatenated in time.
%   merge_thr: 1X2 vector, threshold for two metrics {'A', 'C'}. it merge neurons based
%         on correlations of spatial shapes ('A'),  calcium traces ('C').
%   M:    cell array of length number of days. Within each day's cell, it
%           is As registered towards that day. More detailed in ReadMe for MoBatchVer.
%   dmin: min distance for two neurons to be called different.
%   d1 and d2: row and column of the FOV, for calculating center of each
%         neuron.
% output:
%   Afinal_alldays: merged As for each day. Each day's cell array is put
%       into a seperate cell. For the following output variables, it is essentially
%       the same as MergeAC. For ForMo version, each result becomes a cell
%       array, with ex
%   MC:  see 'help merge_detail'.
%   newIDs: cell array, dim: 1*(number of neurons after merging). Each
%       cell element has the orginal neuron number it has merged from (the
%       nueron number is cumsum across the second dim of A0s).
%   merged_ROIs: essentially the same as newIDs. Left over from previous
%       version. Keep if for now.
%   close_ind: ind of neurons for output (that are merged) just because some neurons are
%       close together.
%   eachday_ind: numbers of neurons that show up in each day.
