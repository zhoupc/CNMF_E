function As=Over_Days_ResequenceA(As,correlation_thresh,max2max2nd,skewnessthresh)
% General description: This function puts neurons that are roughly checked(findn1n2)
% as similar over two consecutive days in similar order. This should help
% make cnmfe-BatchVer more robust since the sequence of initiation might
% effect the result of extracted temporal traces. This function intends to
% preserve the sequence of some similar neurons. The idea is illustrated in
% the following example. If in day1 neuron 2 and 3 is tracked similared to
% neuron 4 and 3 in day2. Then the neurons in day2 will be resequenced as 3
% and 4 while other neurons that have nothing to do with day1's neuron do
% not move.
% Input: 
%   As={A1,A2,A3,A4...}
%   Filters for saying they are the same neuron: correlation_thresh, ratio of first max/second max correlation coef, skewnessthresh.
%   Type help findn1n2 for more information for skewnessthresh.
% Output:
%   As: re-sequenced As.
